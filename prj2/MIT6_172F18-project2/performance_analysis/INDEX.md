# Performance Analysis Index

This directory contains documentation of all performance debugging and optimization sessions for the quadtree collision detection implementation.

## Sessions

### ✅ Session #1: O(n²) Bugs in Query Phase
**File:** [01-initial-performance-bugs.md](01-initial-performance-bugs.md)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Summary:** Fixed two critical O(n²) bugs that made quadtree slower than brute-force:
- Bug #1: maxVelocity recomputation (O(n²) overhead)
- Bug #2: Array index linear search (O(n² log n) overhead)

**Result:** Quadtree transformed from slower in 5/7 cases to faster in 6/7 cases, with maximum speedup improving from 1.18x to 2.68x.

### ✅ Session #2: Memory Safety Bugs
**File:** [02-memory-safety-bugs.md](02-memory-safety-bugs.md)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Summary:** Fixed three critical memory safety issues:
- Bug #1: Memory leaks in error paths (lineIdToIndex not freed in 4 error paths)
- Bug #2: Buffer overflow risk (array access without bounds checking)
- Bug #3: Incorrect bounds check operator (`>` instead of `>=`)

**Result:** Eliminated memory leaks, prevented buffer overflow, and fixed bounds check. No performance impact.

### ✅ Session #3: Build Phase Analysis and Optimization
**File:** [03-candidate-pair-analysis.md](03-candidate-pair-analysis.md)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Summary:** Identified build phase as primary bottleneck (84-91% of time) and implemented bounding box caching:
- Fixed build phase timing instrumentation
- Implemented Optimization #1: Cache bounding boxes to eliminate redundant computation
- Discovered candidate generation is near-optimal (0.9x-1.2x ratio gap)
- Tree structure is appropriate (depth ratios 0.78x-1.01x)

**Result:** Mixed results from bounding box caching (build time increased slightly), but identified the real bottleneck was O(n²) bug in insertLineRecursive.

### ✅ Session #4: Critical O(n²) Bug in insertLineRecursive
**File:** [04-critical-on2-bug-fix.md](04-critical-on2-bug-fix.md)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** RESOLVED  
**Summary:** Fixed critical O(n²) bug where maxVelocity was recomputed for every line during subdivision:
- Bug: insertLineRecursive recomputed maxVelocity O(n) times per line during subdivision
- Fix: Use precomputed tree->maxVelocity instead
- Impact: Eliminated 75% performance overhead (hypot was 75.16% of time)

**Result:** **10.3x improvement, 25.7x speedup vs brute-force!** Quadtree now faster in 7/7 cases (100%).

### ✅ Optimization #1: Line Length Caching
**File:** [05-line-length-caching.md](05-line-length-caching.md)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Summary:** Precompute and cache line segment length to eliminate expensive sqrt() operations in collision solver:
- Problem: Line length computed twice per collision using expensive `Vec_length()` (calls `hypot()`)
- Solution: Add `cachedLength` field to Line struct, compute once per frame in `updatePosition()`
- Impact: Eliminates thousands of redundant sqrt() calls per frame for high collision density inputs

**Expected Result:** Significant reduction in sqrt() operations, especially for inputs with many collisions (e.g., sin_wave.in with 279,712 collisions).

### ✅ Optimization #2: Maximum Quadtree Depth Tuning
**File:** [06-maxdepth-tuning.md](06-maxdepth-tuning.md)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented and Analyzed  
**Summary:** Analyzed optimal maxDepth values across different input sizes:
- Problem: Fixed maxDepth=12 may not be optimal for all input sizes
- Solution: Added environment variable support (`QUADTREE_MAXDEPTH`) and benchmarked different values
- Impact: Current default (12) is optimal for large inputs; small/medium inputs could benefit from 10-18

**Key Finding:** Current default maxDepth=12 is optimal for large inputs (koch.in, 3901 lines), which are most performance-critical. Small inputs benefit from maxDepth=10 (18% faster), but overall default is well-chosen.

### ✅ Optimization #3: Velocity Magnitude Caching
**File:** [07-velocity-magnitude-caching.md](07-velocity-magnitude-caching.md)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Summary:** Precompute and cache velocity magnitude to eliminate expensive sqrt() operations in bounding box calculations:
- Problem: Velocity magnitude computed twice per line per frame (build + query phases) using expensive `Vec_length()`
- Solution: Add `cachedVelocityMagnitude` field to Line struct, compute once per frame in `updatePosition()`
- Impact: Eliminates 50% of sqrt() calls for velocity magnitude (from 2n to n per frame)

**Expected Result:** Significant reduction in sqrt() operations, especially for large inputs (e.g., koch.in: 3,901 fewer sqrt() calls per frame).

### ✅ Optimization #4: Intersection Angle Optimization
**File:** [08-intersection-angle-optimization.md](08-intersection-angle-optimization.md)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Implemented  
**Summary:** Replace expensive `atan2()` calls with cross product to determine angle sign in intersection testing:
- Problem: `Vec_angle()` calls `atan2()` twice (expensive trigonometric function) to compute full angle
- Solution: Use cross product to determine angle sign instead of computing full angle value
- Impact: Eliminates 2 `atan2()` calls per angle computation, replacing with 1 cheap cross product (10-20x faster)

**Key Insight:** We only need the sign of the angle (positive/negative), not the full angle value. Cross product provides this information without expensive trigonometry.

### 📋 Optimization #5: Incremental Quadtree Updates
**File:** [09-incremental-updates-design.md](09-incremental-updates-design.md), [09-incremental-updates-analysis.md](09-incremental-updates-analysis.md)  
**Date:** December 2025  
**Status:** 📋 Design Documented, Implementation Deferred  
**Summary:** Design for incremental quadtree updates instead of full rebuild each frame:
- Problem: Quadtree rebuilt every frame (O(n log n) cost) even when few lines moved
- Solution: Keep tree alive, track old positions, update only moved lines (O(log n) per moved line)
- Complexity: High - correctness-critical, many edge cases
- Status: Design documented, implementation deferred due to complexity and uncertain benefit

**Recommendation:** Document design for future implementation. Focus on simpler optimizations first. Implement if build phase becomes bottleneck or profiling shows significant benefit.

## Methodology

Each debugging session follows this process:

1. **Problem Identification** - Observe performance issue
2. **Root Cause Analysis** - Find the bug (profiling, code review)
3. **Impact Assessment** - Measure how bad it is
4. **Solution Design** - Plan the fix
5. **Implementation** - Write the code
6. **Verification** - Test correctness and performance
7. **Documentation** - Record what was learned

---

## Tools Used

- **Benchmarking:** `scripts/benchmark.sh` - Automated performance testing
- **Profiling:** `perf` - CPU profiling to identify bottlenecks (Session #4)
- **Code Analysis:** Manual code review, complexity analysis
- **Verification:** Correctness checks, performance benchmarks

---

## Key Metrics Tracked

- **Correctness:** Collision counts must match between algorithms
- **Speedup:** Ratio of brute-force time to quadtree time
- **Complexity:** Theoretical vs actual complexity
- **Overhead:** Unnecessary operations identified and eliminated
